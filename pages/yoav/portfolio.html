                Since chiedhood I remember myself with console controller in my hands. <br>
                Video games are my biggest passion and my dream. <br>
                I play video games on my pc and my PlayStation 5, but I used to play on the PS2, PS3,PS4 and on Nintendo's Game Boy. <br>
                My dream job is becoming very well known game developer and very rispected game developer in the industry and gaming community. <br>
                I'm so passioned with video games that I have a tatto of "Super Mario" on My back. <br>

                My favorite music depends on my mood like most of the people in the planet. <br>
                but i prefer classic songs and artists from the late 70s and 80s like Freddie Mercury, Michael Jackson, AC/DC, Dani Senderson, Arik Einstein.
                My favorite song is "Hotel California" by the Eagles because of the great guitar solo and the amazing hidden meaning behind the lyrics. <br>
                I play a little bit on Guitar and Piano but not usually

            <p class="main-text">
                The thing that I most recognized as is that I'm Hapoel Tel-Aviv's fan. <br>
                I don't why I accepted my uncle's offer to come with him to my first game but it was amazing. <br>
                the crowd of Hapoel is something different, they are, we are the greatest crowd in Israel and I believe that we are the best on the entire planet. <br>
                My team isn't the best right now or at the last 8 years but I have hopes that one day our talented players that come from the youth academy will lead us to with the championship
